# Assignment 7
The purpose of this exercise is to give you some experience at working with making with for Loops

Write a for loop that will display all the odd numbers and their squares. 

Display: 
```
1 squared: 1
3 squared: 9 
5 Squared: 25
```
and so on. 

Note the space after the number – i.e. `1squared` (no space after squared and colon character) 
But there is the space after the colon character `(:)` :squareofthenumber”
