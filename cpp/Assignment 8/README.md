# Assignment 8

The purpose of this exercise is to give you some experience at working with loops. 

To write this program you need the file that is attached that contain a long list of random numbers.

Write a program that opens the file, reads all the numbers from the file, and calculates the following:

* The number of numbers in the file
* The sum of all the numbers in the file (a running total)
* The average of all the numbers in the file
* The program should display the number of numbers found in the file, the sum of the numbers, and the average of the numbers.

We use the file [`random.txt`](random.txt) to use the values on the program
