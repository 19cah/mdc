# Assignment 4

The purpose of this exercise is to give you some experience at working with the setw manipulator
A movie theater only keeps a percentage of the revenue earned from ticket sales. The remainder goes to the movie distributor.
Write a program that calculates a theater’s gross and net box office profit for a night. The program should ask for the name of the movie, and how many adult and child tickets were sold. (The price of an adult ticket is $10.00 and child’s ticket is $6.00.) It should display a report similar to:


```
Movie Name:                                                         “Wheels of Fury”

Adult Ticket Sold:                                                         382

Child Ticket Sold:                                                         127

Gross Box Office Profit:                                               $ 4,582.00

Net Box Office Profit:                                                 $   916.40

Amount Paid to Distributor:                                            $ 3,665.60
```
