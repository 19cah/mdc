A movie theater only keeps a percentage of the revenue earned from ticket sales. The remainder goes to the movie distributor.

Movie Name:                                                         “Wheels of Fury”

Child Ticket Sold:                                                         127

Gross Box Office Profit:                                               $ 4,582.00

Net Box Office Profit:                                                 $   916.40
