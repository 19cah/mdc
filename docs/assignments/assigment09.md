## Assignment 9

The purpose of this exercise is to give you some experience at working with nested for loops.

Write a program that ask the user for a positive integer no greater than 15. The program should then display a square on the screen using the character ‘X’. The number entered by the user will be the length of each side of the square. For example, if the user enters 5, the program should display the following:

```text
XXXXX
XXXXX
XXXXX
XXXXX
XXXXX
```

If the user enters `8`, the program should display the following:

```text
XXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXX
```
