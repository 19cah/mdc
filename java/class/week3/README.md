## An object is an instance of a class

Whatever comes after new is a contructor

```java

[Class modifiers]class ClassName
                    [extends SuperClass]
                    [implements Interface 1,
                     Interface2, ...]
                     {
                         ClassMember Declarations
                     }

```                    
Class modifires:

- public
- private 
- abstract
- final

Constructors: are use to initialize objects.
