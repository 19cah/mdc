## An object is an instance of a class

Whatever comes after new is a contructor

```java

[Class modifiers]class ClassName
                    [extends SuperClass]
                    [implements Interface 1,
                     Interface2, ...]
                     {
                         ClassMember Declarations
                     }

```                    
Class modifires:

- public
- private 
- abstract
- final

Constructors: are use to initialize objects.

**Data filds** are like global variable in `C++` between the `class`

Static variables and static methods are shared by all the instances of the class.

## Visibilitty modifiers

`public`: is visible to any class in any package.

`private`: can be accessed only by the declaring class.

## Classes

- Date Class 
```
java.util.Date = new java.util.Date();
System.out.println(date.toString());
```
- Random Class
- 


## Instance Member 

``` java

My Ingteger x = new MyInteger(s);

s.isEven();
```

## Static Member
``` java

My Ingteger x = new MyInteger(s);

MInteger.isEven();
```
