## Carlorie Tracker

Your doctor says you are too heavy and wants you to keep track of your daily caloric intake.
Therefore, she asked you to keep track of how many calories you eat every day on each of your
meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks) for a week.

Write a program that stores this information in a two dimensional 7 Ã— 4 array, where each row
represents a day of the week and each column represents a different meal. The program should
first ask the user to input the data (calories) for each meal and day. Then it should create a report
that includes the following information:

1. Total caloric consumption for each day of the week.
2. Average daily caloric consumption for the whole week.
3. The smallest amount of calories eaten during the week in any of the meals (clearly state
day and meal).
4. The biggest amount of calories eaten during the week in any of the meals (clearly state
day and meal).
Additional requirements:
1. Your class must be named CalorieTracker.
2. Create a method to obtain the user input.
3. Create methods to compute and display each of the quantities above (1-4).
4. Do not accept negative numbers for calories.
